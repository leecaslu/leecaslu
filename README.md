- 👋 Hi, I’m @leecaslu
- 👀 Chess and classical music are my passion! I'm learning to code and starting my portfolio on the GitHub Community, where I hope I can learn more and eventually participate on new projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python 3, but I look forward on developing myself on SQL and JavaScript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with any team with a project that needs a Python intermediate coder.
- 📫 How to reach me: Feel free to contact me through GitHub
